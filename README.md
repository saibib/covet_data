# HPAT_Data

The goal of this project is to pick out unique and useful keywords from comments in a region's subreddit. For example, outputs from r/NewYork might be Cuomo, nursing homes, New York State Education Department, and others. This data will be used when the ethnography committee interviews people from New York. 

To get Reddit data we used the Pushshift API and the following COVID-19 related phrases: 
(covid|lockdown|covid19|covid%19|number%of%deaths|cases%increase|stimulus%check|cases%decrease|essential%worker|coronavirus|pandemic|corona|social%distancing|quarantine|contagious|tested%positive|flatten%the%curve|immunocompromised|test%positive|n95|ppe|the%virus|face%mask)
